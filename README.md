The project is built upon the foundation of Problem Set 2 from the course CSC411 Intro to AI.
My task involves implementing an A* algorithm for a robot so that it can traverse from point A to point B with the least number of moves possible.
Based on the provided environment, I implemented an A* Pathfinding agent that has a 95% performance score.
